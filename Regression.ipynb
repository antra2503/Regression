        "**Q1. What is Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Simple Linear Regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two variables: one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (response). It aims to establish a linear equation in the form of Y = mX + c, where m is the slope and c is the intercept. The model assumes a linear relationship between the variables and is used to predict the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable. It finds applications in various fields like finance, healthcare, and business for predicting trends and making decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Simple Linear Regression operates under several key assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Independence: The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Homoscedasticity: The variance of residuals should remain constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Normality: The residuals should follow a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "No multicollinearity: Since simple regression involves only one predictor, this assumption is not relevant here. However, in multiple regression, independent variables should not be highly correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3. What does the coefficient m represent in the equation Y = mX + c?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> In the regression equation Y = mX + c, the coefficient m represents the slope of the regression line. It quantifies the rate at which the dependent variable (Y) changes for every one-unit increase in the independent variable (X). A positive slope indicates a direct relationship, meaning as X increases, Y also increases. Conversely, a negative slope means that as X increases, Y decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4. What does the intercept c represent in the equation Y = mX + c?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The intercept c in the regression equation is the point at which the regression line crosses the Y-axis. It represents the predicted value of Y when X is zero. In real-world applications, the intercept provides a baseline prediction, but its interpretation should be meaningful within the data context.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q5. How do we calculate the slope m in Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The slope m is calculated using the formula:\n",

        "--> The least squares method is used to minimize the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values. This approach ensures the best-fitting line, reducing errors and improving prediction accuracy.

        "\n",
        "--> The key difference is the number of independent variables. Simple Linear Regression involves one independent variable, whereas Multiple Linear Regression involves two or more predictors. MLR provides a more detailed analysis but requires handling additional assumptions like multicollinearity.\n",

        "**Q10. What are the key assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> MLR shares similar assumptions with Simple Linear Regression but includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "No Multicollinearity: Independent variables should not be highly correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Independent Errors: No autocorrelation in residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Homoscedasticity: Variance of residuals should remain constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linearity: Relationships between dependent and independent variables should be linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violations may require transformations or alternative modeling techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q11. What is heteroscedasticity, and how does it affect the results of a Multiple Linear Regression model?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Heteroscedasticity occurs when residuals exhibit unequal variance across different values of the independent variable. This violates the assumption of homoscedasticity and can lead to unreliable standard errors, affecting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. Remedies include log transformations or weighted regression techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q12. How can you improve a Multiple Linear Regression model with high multicollinearity?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> To address multicollinearity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Remove highly correlated variables using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor).\n",
        "\n",
        "Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Ridge or Lasso Regression, which apply penalties to reduce variable impact\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q13. What are some common techniques for transforming categorical variables for use in regression models?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> One-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical values into binary columns (e.g., Male → [1,0], Female → [0,1]).\n",
        "\n",
        "Label Encoding: Assigns numeric labels to categories (e.g., Small=0, Medium=1, Large=2).\n",
        "\n",
        "Dummy Variables: Creates new binary columns while avoiding the dummy variable trap.\n",
        "\n",
        "These techniques enable categorical data to be used in regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q14. What is the role of interaction terms in Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> In Multiple Linear Regression, interaction terms play a crucial role in capturing the combined effect of two or more independent variables on the dependent variable. These terms help in modeling situations where the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable depends on the level of another independent variable. Without interaction terms, the regression model assumes that each independent variable contributes to the dependent variable independently, which is not always true in real-world scenarios. For example, in predicting salary, both education level and years of experience may individually impact salary, but their combined effect might be more significant. A highly educated person may benefit more from experience compared to someone with less education, and this relationship can be captured using an interaction term. Mathematically, interaction terms are represented as the product of two independent variables (e.g.,\n",
        "𝑋\n",
        "1\n",
        "×\n",
        "𝑋\n",
        "2\n",
        "). When included in the regression model, interaction terms allow the slope of one independent variable to change depending on the value of another, improving the model’s accuracy in representing complex relationships. However, adding interaction terms also increases model complexity and can lead to multicollinearity if not handled carefully. Proper feature selection, scaling, and testing for statistical significance are necessary when using interaction terms in a regression model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q15. How can the interpretation of intercept differ between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The interpretation of the intercept in a regression model varies significantly between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression. In Simple Linear Regression, the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is equal to zero. Mathematically, in the equation\n",

In many cases, such values do not make practical sense, and the intercept may not provide a useful real-world interpretation. It is often more meaningful to focus on the slopes of the independent variables rather than the intercept itself. However, in cases where a zero value for all predictors is reasonable, the intercept provides a useful reference point for understanding how the dependent variable behaves in the absence of any influence from the predictors.\n",

        "--> Polynomial Regression differs from Linear Regression primarily in how it models the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In Linear Regression, the assumption is that the relationship between the variables is linear, meaning that a straight line can best represent the data. This is expressed in the equation Y = mX + c, where changes in X result in proportional changes in Y. Linear Regression is easy to interpret and computationally efficient, making it widely used in various applications such as business forecasting and trend analysis.\n",

        "**Q18. What are the limitations of using R² as a sole measure of model performance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The coefficient of determination, R², is a widely used metric to evaluate the goodness of fit of a regression model. It represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. While a high R² value indicates that the model explains a significant portion of the variance, relying solely on R² as a performance measure can be misleading. One major limitation is that R² does not indicate whether the model is appropriate for the data. A high R² might result from overfitting, where the model captures noise instead of the true underlying pattern. Additionally, R² does not consider the number of predictors in a model, meaning that adding more independent variables will always increase R², even if the additional variables do not significantly contribute to predictive accuracy. To address this, the adjusted R² metric is used, which penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary predictors. Another issue is that R² does not provide insight into whether the model’s assumptions are satisfied, such as normality of residuals or homoscedasticity. For example, a high R² does not mean that the model’s predictions are unbiased or reliable. Furthermore, in cases of non-linear relationships, a low R² may incorrectly suggest a poor model fit, even though a different model (such as polynomial regression) might perform better. Thus, R² should always be used alongside other metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Adjusted R², and residual analysis, to ensure a robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q19. How would you interpret a large standard error for a regression coefficient?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> In regression analysis, the standard error of a coefficient measures the precision of the estimated coefficient. A large standard error indicates that there is a high level of uncertainty or variability in the coefficient estimate. This suggests that small changes in the dataset could lead to significant fluctuations in the estimated value of the coefficient. When a coefficient has a large standard error, it means that the predictor variable may not have a stable or reliable effect on the dependent variable. One way to interpret this is through the t-statistic, which is calculated by dividing the coefficient by its standard error. A large standard error results in a smaller t-value, making it less likely for the coefficient to be statistically significant. This means that there is a higher chance that the true effect of the predictor on the response variable is not different from zero, making the variable potentially unimportant in the model. Large standard errors can arise due to multicollinearity, where independent variables are highly correlated, leading to instability in coefficient estimation. They can also result from insufficient sample size, where too few observations lead to large fluctuations in coefficient estimates. To address this issue, techniques such as removing highly correlated variables, increasing sample size, or applying regularization methods like Ridge or Lasso Regression can be used to stabilize coefficient estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q20. How can heteroscedasticity be identified in residual plots, and why is it important to address it?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Heteroscedasticity refers to a situation in regression where the variance of residuals (errors) is not constant across all levels of the independent variable. This violates the assumption of homoscedasticity, which states that residuals should have equal variance for all values of predictors. One of the most common ways to identify heteroscedasticity is by examining residual plots—scatter plots of residuals against fitted values. If the residuals form a distinct pattern, such as a cone shape (widening or narrowing trend), it suggests heteroscedasticity. Another method is using statistical tests such as Breusch-Pagan or White’s test, which formally detect the presence of heteroscedasticity. Addressing heteroscedasticity is crucial because it affects the reliability of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. When residual variance is unequal, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression may produce inefficient and biased standard errors, leading to incorrect p-values and confidence intervals. This means that significance tests for regression coefficients may be unreliable. To correct heteroscedasticity, several approaches can be used, such as log transformations of dependent variables, weighted least squares regression, or using heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors. Correcting heteroscedasticity ensures that the regression model provides unbiased and more reliable estimates.\n",

        "**Q21. What does it mean if a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high R² but low adjusted R²?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> In Multiple Linear Regression, R² and Adjusted R² are used to measure how well the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable. A high R² suggests that the model explains a large portion of the variance in the outcome variable. However, if Adjusted R² is significantly lower, it indicates that some independent variables are not contributing significantly to the model. The reason for this discrepancy is that R² always increases when more predictors are added, even if those predictors are irrelevant. In contrast, Adjusted R² accounts for the number of predictors in the model, penalizing unnecessary variables that do not add real predictive value. If Adjusted R² is much lower than R², it means that the model might be overfitting by including irrelevant predictors. This can lead to poor generalization on new data. To address this issue, feature selection techniques such as Backward Elimination, Forward Selection, Lasso Regression, or Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis can be used to remove unnecessary predictors. Keeping only the most significant features improves model interpretability and reduces overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q22. Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Scaling variables in Multiple Linear Regression is crucial because different predictors may have different units and ranges, which can affect the performance of the regression model. When independent variables are on vastly different scales, the regression coefficients may be distorted, making it difficult to compare their importance. Additionally, models that use gradient-based optimization methods, such as Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Logistic Regression, work more efficiently when features are standardized. Standardization ensures that all variables contribute equally to the model and prevents numerical instability. A common technique for scaling is Standardization (Z-score normalization), where each value is transformed to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Another approach is Min-Max Scaling, which scales values within a fixed range (e.g., 0 to 1). Scaling is especially important when using regularization techniques, as unscaled variables can lead to improper penalty terms. By standardizing variables, we ensure a more stable and accurate regression model.\n",

On the other hand, if the polynomial curve oscillates excessively and follows noise in the data, it suggests overfitting.\n",
